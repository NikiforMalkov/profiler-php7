Profiler is a system-wide performance monitoring system, that is built on top
of [XHProf](http://pecl.php.net/package/xhprof) or its forks ([Uprofiler](https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/uprofiler)

Profiler continually gathers function-level profiler data from production tier by running a sample of page requests
under XHProf.
